# xArm6 Teleoperation Workspace

This repository provides a ROS 2 Humble workspace for controlling an xArm6 robot using data streamed from a Unity scene. The project is organised as follows:

- **`unity/`** – Unity assets and scripts used to publish controller poses over a ROS bridge.
- **`src/`** – ROS 2 packages containing the bridge and the robot controllers.

Each directory includes its own README with setup instructions and further details.
